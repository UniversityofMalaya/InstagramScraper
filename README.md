# InstagramScraper

# Installing Package

```bash
pip install selenium 
```
 
 The Selenium package creates a dummy web browser that can used to download instagram data like posts of a user, follows,following and other data.
 
 # Drivers
 
 Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser. Firefox, for example, requires geckodriver, which needs to be installed before the below examples can be run. Make sure itâ€™s in your PATH, e. g., place it in /usr/bin or /usr/local/bin.
