# InstagramScraper

# Installing Package

```bash
pip install selenium 
```
 
 The Selenium package creates a dummy web browser that can used to download instagram data like posts of a user, follows,following and other data.
 
 # Drivers
 
 Selenium requires a driver to interface with the chosen browser.The driver creates a dummy       browser that can be used to view and access the webpage.
 You can use your prefered web driver to run the code.
 
 * Chrome  :  https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

 * Firefox :  https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases

 I used Chrome driver to run the code and to download the posts of the user.
